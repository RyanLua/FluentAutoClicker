## Configure your environment

Learn how to configure your environment to develop this project. This assumes you meet the [system requirements for Windows app development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements).

### Using Visual Studio

If you already have Visual Studio installed and have developer mode enabled, you may import the [`.vsconfig` installation configuration file](../.vsconfig).

1. Open the Visual Studio Installer and close Visual Studio.
1. On either the **Installed** tab or the **Available** tab, select **More** > **Import configuration** on the Visual Studio product card.
1. Locate the `.vsconfig` file from the project root, and then choose **Review details**.
1. Verify that your selections are accurate, and then choose **Modify**.

Additionally, Visual Studio will automatically detect any missing components in a open solution and will prompt you to install them if not already installed.

![Solution Explorer suggests additional components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/media/vs-2019/solution-explorer-config-file.png?view=vs-2022)

For more ways to install, learn how to [import or export installation configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/import-export-installation-configurations?view=vs-2022).
